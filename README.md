# FIND MAXIMUM SALARY

In this project creates for finding wo gets maximum salary in that company.

According toÂ JSON.org:
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. And, it is easy for machines to parse and generate.

In this project, i have used  loop through a set of JSON data which has been converted to an array representing Boston employee salaries to find the top five income earners in the city of Boston.
i have used the container parameter's innerHTML property to insert Html tags

In this project i have mentioned some base case to find the 1st five peoples who gets maximum salary and also thier limit is greater than 200k.
